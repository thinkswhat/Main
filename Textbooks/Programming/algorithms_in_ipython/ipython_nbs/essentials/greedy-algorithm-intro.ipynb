In the 0-1 knapsack, we have a given set of items, $i_1, i_2, ..., i_m$, that we can use to fill the knapsack. Again, the knapsack has a fixed capacity, and the items are associated with weights, $w_1, w_2, ..., w_m$, and values $v_1, v_2, ..., v_m$. While our goal is still to pack the knapsack with a combination of items so that it carries the highest possible value, the 0-1 knapsack variation comes with the constraint that we can only carry 1 copy of each item. Thus, the runtime complexity of this algorithm is $O(nW)$, where $n$ is the number of items in the list and $W$ is the maximum capacity of the knapsack.\n",
