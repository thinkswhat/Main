```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

Installation can be done in the normal way:

```{r cars}
install.packages("openair")
library(openair)
```

## Brief examples

In future examples of this workshop, we will use the lab's Hangzhou pollution data.

### Import data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
